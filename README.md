This repository has been made by the help multiple material but specially from this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58N2N7zJGrQ&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRgp46KUv4ZY69yXmpwKOIev&index=1). Check it when you need clarification. This is one of the best  explanation on the subject.

A Finite State Automata is a simple machine with a finite number of state.

**Finite Atomaton** can be divided in two category and then in multiple sub category.

## DFA Deterministic Finite Automaton
## NFA Non-deterministic Finite Automaton
## Conversion of NFA to DFA
**Every DFA is an NFA, but not vice versa.**
**But there is an equivalent DFA for every NFA.**
Because :

To convert an NFA to a DFA you basically just have to add the dead state. like so:
