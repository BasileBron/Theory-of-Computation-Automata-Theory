This repository has been made by the help multiple material but specially from this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58N2N7zJGrQ&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRgp46KUv4ZY69yXmpwKOIev&index=1). Check it when you need clarification. This is one of the best  explanation on the subject.

A Finite State Automata is a simple machine with a finite number of state.

**Finite Atomaton** can be divided in two category and then in multiple sub category.

## DFA Deterministic Finite Automaton
## NFA Non-deterministic Finite Automaton
## Conversion of NFA to DFA
**Every DFA is an NFA, but not vice versa.**
**But there is an equivalent DFA for every NFA.**

Because :

- Example 1.
![map final state automata](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BasileBron/Theory-of-Computation-Automata-Theory/master/img/Convertion_NFA_to_DFA.PNG)
To convert this NFA to a DFA you basically just have to add the dead state. like so.

- Example 2

To convert this NFA to a DFA you have tu "cheat" by adding a state that stand for the equivalent of the multiple state of the NFA.
